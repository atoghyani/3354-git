(c) What is the difference between git log and git status?

git status shows the latest changes that have not been commited yet.
git log lists the commits already made in the repo in reverse order.
 
(d) What is the difference between unstaged and untracked files?

untracked file is a file that was not in the previous snapshot of the repo.
unstaged file means that it will not be included in the next commmit. so a differnet version of a file might be tracked but unstaged. but all untracked files are also unstaged.

git reset updates the index, moving the HEAD every time. but a git checkout only moves the head if we checkout of a branch.

it does not allow us to do so, unless the changes are committed or stashed first.
